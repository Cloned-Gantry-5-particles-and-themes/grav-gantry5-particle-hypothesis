# Gantry 5 'Hypothesis' Particle for Grav

Particles are small, modular blocks with preset scripting that enable you to add elements to your Grav Gantry 5 pages.

## Installing the Particle

1. Open the folder of your active Gantry theme. For example, if you are using the Hydrogen theme open the folder `/user/themes/g5_hydrogen`.
2. If a `custom` folder already exists open it, otherwise create it.
3. If a `particles` folder already exists within the `custom` folder open it, otherwise create it.
4. Upload `hypothesis.html.twig` and `hypothesis.yaml` files into the `/custom/particles` folder. For example, if you are using the Hydrogen theme copy the two particle files into `/user/themes/g5_hydrogen/custom/particles`.
